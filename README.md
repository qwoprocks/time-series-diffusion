# Time Series Diffusion

This is a CMU school project, where we try applying diffusion models on discontinuous time series data. The data we are operating on is from the [Optiver - Trading at the Close](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close) Kaggle competition.

## Data

Please download the data from this Kaggle dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi20076/optiver-memoryreduceddatasets/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi20076/optiver-memoryreduceddatasets/data) and place it in the `data_raw` folder before running the code.

## Running

The data processing code and our exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be found in `eda.ipynb`, please run this notebook before running `main.ipynb`.

The code for all our models can be found in `main.ipynb`, just run the notebook sequentially and it should give you the same outputs.
